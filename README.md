This is the Fialka Encryption simulation used by the Soviet Union during the cold war. The file with (WIP) written was a work in progress, a simulation of the encryption system in which you couldn't change the rotor orders.
The newer file, is the Fialka Encryption system simulation in which you can change the rotor functions, just like the Soviet Union did.
This specific project is still under-development (Mainly cuz I have uni and a job coming so ye, development will go dark for a while)
